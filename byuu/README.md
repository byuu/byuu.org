From v091 to v107, [higan](../higan/) referred to
byuu's multi-system emulator project as a whole.

In v108,
inspired by the popularity of the revived [bsnes](../bsnes/),
byuu added less-accurate, high-performance scanline renderers
for many of the emulation cores in higan
(like bsnes' optional high-performance mode),
and an alternative, bsnes-style user-interface.

Builds of v108 with both the bsnes-style scanline renderers
and the bsnes-style UI were released under the project name "byuu".
Meanwhile, builds of v108 with the traditional dot-based renderers
and the complex user-interface were released under the project name "higan".
It was possible to produce an emulator
with byuu's renderers and higan's interface,
or the other way around,
although such combinations were never officially released
and did not have unique names.

Thus, from the release of v108 onward:

  - "higan" could refer to just the complex user-interface,
    to the traditional dot-based renderers,
    or to the project as a whole.
  - "byuu" could refer to just the simplified user-interface,
    to the high-performance scanline-based renderers,
    or the original name of the project's author.

The source-code of byuu-the-project
is still part of the [higan source](https://github.com/higan-emu/higan),
so look there for more information.
